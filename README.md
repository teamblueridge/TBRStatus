TBR Status by Team BlueRidge
==
TBR Status is a small, simple app which tells the status of Team BlueRidge's services through an app.

To update service status
----------------
The app uses [tbrstatus.json](https://github.com/teamblueridge/TBRStatus/blob/master/tbrstatus.json) to get the status. So when status of a service is changed, corresponding JSONObject should be changed.
