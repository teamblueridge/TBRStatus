TBR Status by Team BlueRidge
==
TBR Status is a small, simple app which tells the status of Team BlueRidge's services through an app.

To update service status
----------------
The app fetches the [tbrstatus.txt file](https://github.com/teamblueridge/TBRStatus/blob/master/tbrstatus.txt) and then sets the status according to line of file.

* Line 1 corresponds to Main site
* Line 2 corresponds to Paste
* Line 3 corresponds to Wiki
* Line 4 corresponds to Gerrit
* Line 5 corresponds to Projects
* Line 6 corresponds to Jenkins
* Line 7 corresponds to File Server
* Line 8 corresponds to Buildbox

So in any case, the status of a service changes, corresponding line should be changed.
